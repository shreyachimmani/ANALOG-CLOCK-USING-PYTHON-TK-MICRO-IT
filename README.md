This project is a fullscreen analog clock desktop application built using Python’s Tkinter GUI toolkit. The clock dynamically fills the entire application window, scaling all elements proportionally to the window size, offering a visually appealing and interactive experience.

The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds with smoothly moving hands, rendered using canvas graphics. The clock face includes hour marks and numbers that resize based on the window size. The app starts in fullscreen mode to utilize maximum screen space and supports exiting fullscreen via the Escape key.

This project demonstrates mastery of Python’s Tkinter canvas drawing, time-based animations, event handling, and responsive GUI design principles. It’s ideal as a desktop clock or a screensaver and can be extended with additional features like date display, themes, or alarms.

REQUIREMENTS:
Tkinter library
